SIP Core, part of the SIP-HASS project, is the system that powers Home Assistant cards to make and receive SIP calls using WebRTC.
It includes official cards and popups, but also supports third-party cards.

## Features

  * Make and receive calls
  * Ringtones
  * Video calls
  * DTMF support
  * Popups for incoming calls
  * Auto call on load (using `?call=<number>` in the URL)
  * Custom icons and names per contact
  * Ingress for easy setup
  * Audio device selection
  * API for third-party developers to build custom cards and popups


## Requirements
For this to work you will need the following:
 * A sip/pbx server (Works best with the [Asterisk add-on](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/Asterisk-add-on))
 * HTTPS for Home Assistant
 * HACS for easy installation
