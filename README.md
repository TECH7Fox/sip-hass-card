# sip-hass-card
**A SIP client inside home assistant!**

With this card you can make and receive calls to other HA clients and other sip devices, so you can use it as for example an intercom.

The card supports video, DTMF signals, custom icons, custom names, status entities and camera entities.

## Roadmap
This is still work in progress, and these are the things i want to add in the near future.
 * Improve styling (hard because custom cards can't use all ha elements)
 * Include default ringtones
 * Translations

**Asterisk add-on**
This card works with the [Asterisk add-on](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/Asterisk-add-on), which is very easy to set up, with just some clicks!

## Requirements
For this to work you will need the following:
 * A sip/pbx server. (I use the [Asterisk add-on](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/Asterisk-add-on))
 * Extension for every device. (The add-on auto-generates extensions for every person in HA)
 * HACS on your HA. (Home assistant)

Go to https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/card/guides/freepbx to see how to setup FreePBX for this card.

## Installation
Download using **HACS**
 1. Go to HACS
 2. Click on `Frontend`
 3. Click on the 3 points in the upper right corner and click on `Custom repositories`
 4. Paste https://github.com/TECH7Fox/HA-SIP/ into `Add custom repository URL` and by category choose Lovelace
 5. Click on add and check if the repository is there.
 6. You should now see SIP.js Client. Click `INSTALL`

## Usage
Click on add card and scroll down to and choose `Custom: SIP Card`.
The entire card is configurable from the editor.

### Set Ringtones
set your ringtones to play when calling/being called.
`/local` is your `www` folder in config. Example: `/local/ringtone.mp3` = `/config/www/ringtone.mp3`.

### Auto Call
You can put `?call=<number>` behind the URL to auto call that number when the card loads. Useful for notifications.

### Hide Header Button
You can hide the "Open Call Popup" button that appears in the Home Assistant header by setting `hide_header_button: true` in your `/config/www/sip-config.json` file under `popup_config`. This is useful if you want a cleaner header, especially on mobile devices.

Example:
```json
"popup_config": {
    "hide_header_button": true,
    ...
}
```

### Ice Options
You can set ICE options for external use. These settings are not (yet) configurable with the card editor, so you will
need to set them in the code editor. Don't set `iceConfig` if you don't want to use ICE.

Here is a example:

```
iceTimeout: 5
iceConfig:
  iceCandidatePoolSize: 0
  iceTransportPolicy: all
  iceServers:
    - urls:
        - stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
        - stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302
  rtcpMuxPolicy: require
```

### Card Configuration

Everything (expect ICE) is configurable with the card editor.
But for people that are configuring it with YAML, here is a example:

```

## Wiki
You can find more information on the [SIP-HASS Docs](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/).

## Troubleshooting
Most problems is because your PBX server is not configured correct, or your certificate is not accepted.
To accept the certificate for Asterisk/FreePBX go to `https://<host>:8089/ws` and click continue.
To see how to configure FreePBX go to the [FreePBX guide](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/card/guides/freepbx).

Android companion app 2022.2 required for speaker + audio permissions.

If you are still having problems you can make an issue or ask on the discord server. 

## Development
For development on Windows, easiest way is to use the devcontainer and run `npm run build` in the terminal. Then copy the `sipjs-card.js` file to your `www` folder.
You can ask for help on the discord server.
